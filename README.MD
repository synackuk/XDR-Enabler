# XDR-Enabler
Fully unlock the full brightness of your XDR MacBook display.


This project works in the same way as the popular [lunar](https://lunar.fyi) and [BetterDisplay](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay) projects, which allow users to access the full 1600 nit brightness of their MacBook displays, without watching HDR content. They do this by setting up a custom colour profile, which allows for SDR content to be viewed at 1600 nits.
